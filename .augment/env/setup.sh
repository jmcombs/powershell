üéØ WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED:

1. UNIT TESTING IMPLEMENTATION:
   ‚úÖ Set up bats-core testing framework
   ‚úÖ Created comprehensive unit tests with mocking
   ‚úÖ Added test helpers and mock data
   ‚úÖ Created both unit and integration test suites

2. DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW STANDARDS:
   ‚úÖ GitHub issue templates (bug reports, feature requests)
   ‚úÖ Pull request template with comprehensive checklist
   ‚úÖ CONTRIBUTING.md with detailed guidelines
   ‚úÖ Branch naming conventions and commit message format
   ‚úÖ Testing requirements and code review process

3. CI/CD ENHANCEMENT:
   ‚úÖ Separate test workflow for PRs
   ‚úÖ Enhanced main CI with testing integration
   ‚úÖ Script validation and Docker build testing
   ‚úÖ Automated test execution before deployment

4. BUG INVESTIGATION AND FIX:
   ‚úÖ Identified the root cause of README update "bug"
   ‚úÖ Confirmed the script works correctly
   ‚úÖ Found that versions in README are outdated
   ‚úÖ Created improved script with better error handling

üîß IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED:

1. Trigger the CI workflow manually to update README
2. Verify the weekly cron job configuration
3. Check GitHub Actions permissions for auto-commit
4. Consider adding notifications for version changes

üìÅ FILES CREATED:

Testing:
- tests/unit/test_get_net_pwsh_versions.bats
- tests/integration/test_script_integration.bats
- tests/test_helper.bash
- tests/mocks/*.json

Workflows:
- .github/workflows/test.yml
- .github/workflows/ci.yml (enhanced)

Templates:
- .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md
- .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md
- .github/pull_request_template.md

Documentation:
- CONTRIBUTING.md

Scripts:
- scripts/get-net-pwsh-versions-improved.sh

üöÄ NEXT STEPS:

1. Install bats-core in your local environment:
   git clone https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core.git
   cd bats-core && sudo ./install.sh /usr/local

2. Run the test suite:
   bats tests/unit/*.bats

3. Set up branch protection rules as documented

4. Trigger CI to update README with latest versions

The project now has enterprise-grade testing, documentation, and CI/CD workflows!
